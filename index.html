    <h1>Hello, I'm Tino</h1>

    <p>
      I am Tino Rusch, software architect from Magdeburg, Germany.
      Mainly I'm focused on backend developing, doing my best to make the Internet of Things happen.
      Besides being a developer I'm a loving dad and husband.
    </p>

    <p>
      My favorite language is <a href="https://golang.org">go</a> and nearly all my current projects are written in that language.
      When not coding go, C and C++ are my best weapons when it comes to interfacing low-level stuff.

    <h2>This Page</h2>

    <p>
      To be honest, this page only exists to give me some webspace to host my public
      <a href="./gpg">gpg</a> and <a href="./ssh">ssh</a> keys and some of my
      <a href="./aci">ACI's</a>. And it is a nice way to represent myself on the internet. Much cooler than a facebook account, isn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
      I will update this page from time to time, but please don't expect this to happen often.
